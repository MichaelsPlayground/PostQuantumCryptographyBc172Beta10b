The NIST PQC competition continues
Late last year, it was announced that the final algorithm set from the NIST PQC competition would be 
chosen in late March of this year. As one speaker so eloquently put it, we are now in late March, for 
very large values of late. NIST have not made any further announcements and the submission teams do 
not appear to have more information either. A possible reason for the pause is that there have been 
further advances in analysis of the candidates. An attack on Rainbow has meant that all its parameter 
sets have been effectively downgraded one level in security, more recently an improved dual lattice 
attack has been published which also downgrades the security of algorithms like SABER, Crystals-Dilithium, 
and Crystals-Kyber. This does not mean that any of these algorithms are inherently broken, but it may 
mean that parameter sizes need to be revised and this has knock-on effects as to the utility of the 
algorithms which probably in turn affects an algorithm's suitability for selection. So maybe – just 
maybe – NIST are having a bit more of a think. One thing seems clear: the "shape", as it were, of the 
algorithms we will migrate to in the future does not look like it's going to change. More on this one 
a bit later!
